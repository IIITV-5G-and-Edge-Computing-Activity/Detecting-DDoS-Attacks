# DDoS Prediction System for 5G Networks üåê

## üöÄ Overview  
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are among the most severe threats to the stability of modern communication networks, especially with the advent of **5G**. This project presents an **ML-based DDoS prediction system** that leverages real-time anomaly detection to secure 5G networks. The system offers **high accuracy, minimal latency**, and a **user-friendly dashboard**, making it an effective tool for network administrators.

---

## ‚ú® Features  
- **Real-Time Traffic Analysis**: Detect DDoS attacks with minimal latency.  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Employ advanced algorithms like **Random Forest**, **KNN**, and **Naive Bayes**.  
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize network activity and anomalies with ease.  
- **Scalable Design**: Tailored to handle the high volume and complexity of 5G traffic.

## üõ† System Architecture  
### Components  
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Collects and cleans network traffic data.  
   - Extracts key features: Source IP, Destination IP, Protocol, and DDoS Label.

2. **Machine Learning Module**  
   - Implements predictive models for real-time anomaly detection.

3. **Visualization & Mitigation Module**  
   - Interactive dashboard for monitoring and mitigating threats.

### Workflow  
1. **Data Ingestion**: Traffic collected from 5G nodes.  
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction.  
3. **Prediction**: ML models identify anomalies.  
4. **Visualization**: Insights displayed via an interactive dashboard.

## üìä Results  
### Model Performance  
The system achieves exceptional results, as summarized below:

| Model          | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|----------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Random Forest** | 97.5%    | 96.8%     | 98.3%  | 97.5%    |
| **KNN**          | 94.2%    | 93.1%     | 95.6%  | 94.3%    |
| **Naive Bayes**   | 89.7%    | 87.5%     | 91.2%  | 89.3%    |
