# DDoS Prediction System for 5G Networks üåê

## üöÄ Overview  
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are among the most severe threats to the stability of modern communication networks, especially with the advent of **5G**. This project presents an **ML-based DDoS prediction system** that leverages real-time anomaly detection to secure 5G networks. The system offers **high accuracy, minimal latency**, and a **user-friendly dashboard**, making it an effective tool for network administrators.

## üõ† System Architecture  
### Components  
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Dataset should look like the one whicj is present in the sample dataset folder.
   - Collects and cleans network traffic data.  
   - Extracts key features: Source IP, Destination IP, Protocol, and DDoS Label.

3. **Machine Learning Module**  
   - Implements predictive models for real-time anomaly detection.

4. **Visualization & Mitigation Module**  
   - Interactive dashboard for monitoring and mitigating threats.

### Workflow  
1. **Data Ingestion**: Traffic collected from 5G nodes.  
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction.  
3. **Prediction**: ML models identify anomalies.  
4. **Visualization**: Insights displayed via an interactive dashboard.
